# What is abstraction and why is it good idea to add abstraction in your code ?

Abstraction can be thought of simpifing a complex entity and reducing it to a single term. For example, a house is compised of wood, bolts, doors, windows. Buy in conversation all you really say is I live in a house. The 'house' part is an abstraction it's an umbrealla that contains all parts of the house. The same thing can be said in code. It's much better to make modules and create abstractions of more complex types of algorithms . This makes the code base easier to manage and easier to read .
